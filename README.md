# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning

This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** using deep learning. It trains a model to classify different hand gestures from infrared images.  It provides a way to select specific images from the dataset for testing, enhancing the user experience.

## 📂 Dataset Structure

The dataset used is the [Leap Motion Hand Postures](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) dataset from Kaggle.  It consists of **10 different gestures**, performed by **10 different subjects**. The structure is:

Each **gesture folder** contains grayscale images representing different hand gestures.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Deep Learning Model:** Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
*   **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.
*   **Training & Evaluation:**  The code includes training and evaluation scripts.  (You'll need to implement your own train/test split).
*   **Interactive Image Selection for Testing:**  The `test_model.py` script allows users to choose an image from the dataset for testing the model. This provides a more interactive and insightful testing experience.
*   **Prediction Display:** Displays the selected image with the model's prediction and confidence scores.

## 🧑‍💻 Model Training

The CNN model processes the hand gesture images and learns to classify them.  A typical architecture might include:

*   **Convolutional Layers (Conv2D):**  These layers extract features from the images using convolutional filters.  Multiple Conv2D layers are often stacked to learn increasingly complex features.  Consider specifying kernel sizes, strides, and activation functions (e.g., ReLU).  Example:

```python
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 1))) # Example
Max Pooling Layers (MaxPooling2D): These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, which helps to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost, and also makes the model more robust to small variations in the input. Example:
Python

model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Example
Flatten Layer: This layer flattens the multi-dimensional feature maps into a one-dimensional vector, which is then fed into the fully connected layers.
Python

model.add(Flatten())
Dense Layers (Fully Connected): These layers perform high-level reasoning and classification based on the extracted features. Use appropriate activation functions (e.g., ReLU for hidden layers, softmax for the output layer). Example:
Python

model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))  # Example hidden layer
model.add(Dense(NUM_CLASSES, activation='softmax')) # Output layer with softmax
Softmax Activation: The softmax activation function is used in the output layer for multi-class classification. It outputs a probability distribution over the classes.
Example Model Architecture (Adapt this to your specific needs):

Python

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(NUM_CLASSES, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()  # Print model summary
Remember 1  to compile the model with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.  categorical_crossentropy is commonly used for multi-class classification, and adam is a popular optimizer.
